#===# == JULIA SET == #===#

The juliaset.py program can create images and gifs of a fractal generated
by a function of the form f(z) = z*z + c.
- It can zoom on a particular point, 'z0', using a scaling factor called 'zoom'. 
- It can make the fractal turn, by changing the parameter 'c' in the function.
